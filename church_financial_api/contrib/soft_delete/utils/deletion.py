        Add 'objs' to the collection of objects to be deleted as well as all
        parent instances.  'objs' must be a homogeneous iterable collection of
        model instances (e.g. a QuerySet).  If 'collect_related' is True,
        related objects will be handled by their respective on_delete handler.

        If the call is the result of a cascade, 'source' should be the model
        that caused it and 'nullable' should be set to True, if the relation
        can be null.

        If 'reverse_dependency' is True, 'source' will be deleted before the
        current model, rather than after. (Needed for cascading to parent
        models, the one case in which the cascade follows the forwards
        direction of an FK rather than the reverse direction.)

        If 'keep_parents' is True, data of parent model's will be not deleted.

        If 'fail_on_restricted' is False, error won't be raised even if it's
        prohibited to delete such objects due to RESTRICT, that defers
        restricted object checking in recursive calls where the top-level call
        may need to collect more objects to determine whether restricted ones
        can be deleted.
